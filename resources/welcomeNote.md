# Hey there, welcome to NoteMark! 👋🏻

This is your first note, just a little guide to help you get the hang of things. Feel free to play around with it, or just delete it and start your own thing! NoteMark uses a super simple formatting style called **Markdown**.

It's really easy to get started:
* **To make a new note**, just click the little "pen" icon 📝 up in the top-left.
* **To get rid of a note**, click the "trash" icon 🗑️ in the top-right. Simple as that!

### Making Your Notes Look Good!

Here’s how you can add some style to your text. It’s a piece of cake!

#### **Bold Text**
* **Type this:** `**This is bold text**`
* **You'll get this:** **This is bold text**
* **Shortcut:** Just highlight your text and hit `Ctrl + B`.

#### **Italic Text**
* **Type this:** `*This is italic text*`
* **You'll get this:** *This is italic text*
* **Shortcut:** Highlight what you want and press `Ctrl + I`.

#### **Strikethrough**
* **Type this:** `~~Cross this out~~`
* **You'll get this:** ~~Cross this out~~
* **Shortcut:** You guessed it! Select the text and press `Ctrl + Shift + X`.

### **Titles and Subtitles**
Just use the `#` key to make your headings. The more `##` you add, the smaller the title gets.

* **For a big title:** `# Heading 1`
* **For a smaller one:** `## Heading 2`

### **Making Lists**

#### **Bulleted Lists**
Just start a line with a dash `-` and a space.

* **Type this:**
    ```
    - First point
    - Second point
    ```
* **You'll get this:**
    * First point
    * Second point
* **Cool tip:** Once you make a bullet point, just hit `Enter` and it'll make another one for you!

#### **Numbered Lists**
This one's easy, just use numbers!

* **Type this:**
    ```
    1. First step
    2. Second step
    ```
* **You'll get this:**
    1.  First step
    2.  Second step

### A Few More Tricks
#### **Quotes**
To make text stand out, just put a `>` at the start of the line.

* **Type this:** `> This is an important quote.`
* **You'll get this:**
    > This is an important quote.

#### **Code Snippets**
For showing a little bit of code, wrap it in these single backticks: \` \`.

* **Type this:** `Use `const` to declare a variable.`
* **You'll get this:** Use `const` to declare a variable.
